## Questions and Answers

### -> Reflection 

#### 1.2: Understanding how it works
    When I spawn a task using the provided spawner, it initiates an asynchronous process that prints "Andika's Computer: howdy!", then waits for 2 seconds before printing "Andika's Computer: done!". However, before the execution of this task, I insert a synchronous println!("Andika Computer: Hey heyy!"); statement in the main function. Consequently, when the program runs, the synchronous println! statement executes immediately, printing "Andika Computer: Hey heyy!", while the asynchronous task spawned earlier executes subsequently, printing "Andika's Computer: howdy!" after 2 seconds of waiting, followed by "Andika's Computer: done!".
